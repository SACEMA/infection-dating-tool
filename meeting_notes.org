** get outside_eddi ready for Tuesday

generic results produces one row per specimen
other exports full results (looks in specific assay results table)
make available both result queries

** runs - important
assay runs: change tab name to assay results
change filter to allow the user to filter by visit or upload list of visits or list of specimens or say show all visits with data on the selected assays
add run id to export
export generic or full
user visits form
kill delete run button - change permissions for different users / add confirm button
when permission is added - not available by default to new user (Eduard must add permission to users)

issues
take out visit id for combine assay results for visits block
add panel membership filter - if they do not select panel membership then export all results for all panels
add specimen filter (copy specimen filter from visit filter form)
if they do not select anything before selecting get results then export everything

** file upload/download page
if admin you can upload or download or delete files
other users can view files


** eddi calculation
save map for a file and set of results so that the user can review the map used for a result output (save and export file map for later use)
